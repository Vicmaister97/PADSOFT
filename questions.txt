+   How to organize the courses?
+   Exercises automatically corrected      Types of questions on an exercise: -Unique choice    -True False  -Multiple choice    -Questions where student write
+   Each exercise points from 0 to 10, each question has a different value for the mark of the exercise
+   Exercises --> just one try, but whenever you want, you can see the answers (after doing it, obviously)
                                                                ^
+   We must provide the text of the question and the answers----|
+   Given date and time for doing the exercise and an EXPIRATON DATE (so after that moment, the exercise can't be done). It can be changed whenever we want(the teacher account)
+   On every exercise, the results of the questions are saved

+   About 10-15 teachers (with the same account) and 100-1000 students
+   Notification send to students everytime an unit is opened or when he is accepted in a course (email to his account). ALSO WHEN NOTES AND EXERCISES OF A COURSE WHERE HE IS ENROLED APPEAR

+   An unit can be hidden or open.
+   At the same time, just 1 teacher and 1 student
+   When you close the application, changes must stay
+   Students must apply for entering a course
x   We can make forums and that kind of stuff for 1 more point on the mark
+   A graphic interface needed (easy, 4 telecos)
+   Just one teacher account, that can:     -Create courses--Units--Exercises, Notes(plain text) and subUnits   -Can hide stuff
+                                                  {                    can be deleted                       }
+   We give students some credentials
+   At the start of the application, it will appear all the courses
+   At the courses, there isn't a limitation number of students
+   Students can be expelled and readmited on every course
+   Students must be able to see ther progress(marks) on every course (and maybe a global mark?)
+   Teacher account must have stadistics and graphics of the courses
+   In an exercise, teacher must be able to choose if he wants a certain order of the questions or a random order of the questions for each student (ALSO THE ORDER OF THE ANSWERS ON EVERY QUESTION)
+   If someone has answered an exercise, the teacher CAN'T change the questions of it (before that, yes)
+   For every question, the teacher must have the following stadistics:     -Number of students that answered   -Number of correct  -Number of incorrect    -Number of people that didn't answer
+   Per course, teacher can see all this(up) about students + be able to see their marks
+   Student credentials:    Name, ID, Username, password, email
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+   Users can't change his credentials (username...)
+   We asume that the programm will run in one computer, unique access
+   List of students enroled in a course (it may change if someone is expelled or (re)admitted)
+   In questions, multiple choice provides student to clean his answer. Also save changes option and cancel exercises
+   Make_exercises editor/maker
+   Teacher have a list of pending things (like to accept a student in a course)
+   After doing an exercise, the answers and grades not available until the expiration date. HE ALSO CAN SEE WHAT HE ANSWERED
+   Everything can be invisible or visible. If an unit is invisible, everything inside is invisible
+   Exercise_editor:    You choose the type of question, correct answer, answers... You choose the points for every question, and the teacher may be able to choose a penalty if it's incorrect or 0 points. It must be the exact answer to have all the points of the question, if not, 0??? If penalties, not a final mark of -3, just a 0.
+   A student can't leave a course
+   Student should know the relevance of an exercise
+   You can edit notes...       DON'T WORRY ABOUT DELETING THINGS, JUST NOTES
